## Developed the Nxt Watch platform, a YouTube-inspired application where users can access various video
## categories, such as Trending, Gaming, and Saved videos, and search for specific content while customising the
## visual theme.

## ● Crafted a responsive UI with React components for pages like Login, Home, Trending, Gaming, and
Saved videos, utilising event handlers and form inputs.

## ● Established user authentication through username/password input and HTTP API calls, maintaining
login state with JWT tokens and local storage.

## ● Enabled secure navigation using React Router components for protected routes, redirecting
unauthenticated users to the login page.

## Technologies used: React JS, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, Routing, REST API Calls, Local Storage, JWT
Token, Authorization, Authentication

## Future Enhancements:
- **User Profiles**: Allow users to customize their profiles, upload avatars, and manage subscriptions.
- **Comments and Likes**: Implement features for users to comment on videos and express their preferences.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Enhance video recommendations based on user behavior and preferences.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimize the application for mobile devices.
